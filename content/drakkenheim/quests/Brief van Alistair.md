To the [[Hooded Lanterns]], 

I trust this letter finds you in a state of preparedness, as you are often called upon to handle matters that others dare not touch. Today, I am reaching out to you with a matter of great personal urgency that requires your unique talents.

As you know, the [[Kleinberg Estate]] has stood abandoned for years, a decaying monument to a once-great family. However, within its crumbling walls lies a relic of immense importance to my house-a family heirloom long thought lost. This item, [[Alistairs Silver Locket|a silver locket engraved with the crest of my bloodline]] , has been out out of my reach for far too long. Its retrieval is no mere task of sentiment, but a matter of preserving the honor and legacy of the Von Kleinberg name.

I hereby instruct you to make haste to the Estate, retrieve the locket, and deliver it to without delay. I trust you know how to navigate the treacherous and ruinous halls of the mansion, and that the dangers within will be of no consequence to those as capable as yourselves. The heirloom is small, discreet, and invaluable-its return is essential for reasons that should be obvious to any who understand the importance of legacy.

However, let me be clear: if this request is not met with immediate action, I will be forced to reconsider the continued support I have extended to your faction. My funding has been generous, but it is not without limits. Should you fail to recover the heirloom, I will withdraw my patronage without hesitation, and the [[Hooded Lanterns]] will no longer enjoy the resources they have so freely relied upon.

I trust this will not be necessary.

Do not test my resolve. I expect confirmation of your compliance within the week. The locket must be in my hands soon, or the consequences will be... irreparable.

Yours in command,
[[Lord Alistair Von Kleinberg]]
Lord of [[Kleinberg Estate]]
[[House of Von Kleinberg]]
