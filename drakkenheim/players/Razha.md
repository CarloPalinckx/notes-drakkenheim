## Backstory

[[Silverblood Empire]]

[[Tymora]], god of good fortune made a deal with the first of the Silverblood, [[Arnon]]. A poor man from a town that was enduring a famine. They formed a blood pact that would give Arnon great magical powers to save his town from extinction on the one condition that they would always use the powers granted for spreading good fortune to those around him. This bloodpact turned Arnons blood in silver that could be seen through the skin every time Arnon would call on these powers. Then and there the Silverblood were born.

After generations of wealth and prosperity the Silverblood betrayed their pact with Tymora by waging war on the less fortunate surrounding kingdoms. Tymora punished the silverblood by taking away the powers that were gifted to them so that they could never hoard their wealth anymore. Because this power was literally imbued into their blood. This meant total extinction for the Silverblood race.

So everyone thoughtâ€¦ until one day Razha discovered that he could manipulate the sword that was passed down to him before he became orphaned. Razha has ever since been searching for the origins of his powers.
